# SapientInterview

View the project at `https://amrishkhan05.github.io/SpaceXDataView/`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

Also I have changed the following in angular.json for hosting it using github pages

"outputPath": "dist/SapientInterview/browser" ==> "outputPath": "dist/"

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng build --prod --base-href https://githubusername.github.io/SpaceXDataView/` to host the app in githubpages

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
